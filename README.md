# GDstats
GDstats is a tool for Geometry Dash that tracks where you die on each attempt and then visualizes that data. Its potential uses include analyzing playstyles, deciding where to practice in a level, balancing levels during playtesting, and verifying the legitimacy of a level completion or verification.

I originally made GDstats for myself to use during my Bloodbath completion (work in progress on that one), but after showing it to some friends and hearing their desire to try it themselves, I decided to go through the lengthy process of packing into a nice little executable and making it public.
